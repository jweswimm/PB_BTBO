<h1>Autonomous Sailing</h1>
Objective: Create a series of tools, software, and philosophy behind an autonomous sailboat. Test and apply to my own boat. This is split up into various parts:

* Theoretical Uses & Philosophy
* Server
* Boat health diagnostics and surveilance 
* Navigation
* Communication
* Control
* MC Informed Guidance
* Displays & Interfaces

<h2>Theoretical Uses & Philosophy</h2>
I want to build the most technologically advanced boat in the world.
The boat should be able to sail itself to given coordinates and be completely controllable by the lead engineer.
<h3> Philosophy</h3>

**Robustness**: The boat should be able to sail effectively and respond to inclement weather. The controllable physical inputs to the boat should be durable. The boat should be supplied with enough batteries and solar panels to properly power the electrical systems on board. 

**Engineering**: There's something extremely special about developing systems from the ground up. Here we can create a unique suite of technology that has the potential to benefit the lives of an incredible community. Proper documentation is going to be extremely important and I must stay true to regularly including .md notes where necessary.

<h3> Safety Drone </h3>
This could be used as a smaller boat following a larger sailing vessel. This drone could carry more equipment, food, surfboards, fishing poles, etc. 

<h3> Overnight Crossings </h3>
Sailing while tired is dangerous. Open ocean crossings require concentration and planning. If the sailor could sleep more because an autonomous system is properly operating their boat, they may have a safer passage

<h2> Server </h2>
Signal K is the answer. My current ideas:

- Raspberry Pi running [Signal K](https://signalk.org/)
    - [Guide](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server)
